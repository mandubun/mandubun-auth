    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 15, 2026</p>

    <p>Mandubun is a Chrome extension that helps you learn Korean by reading
  Naver Webtoons. This policy explains what data we collect, why, and how we
  protect it.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Account Information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Email address</strong> — collected when you sign in with
  Google via Supabase authentication. Used to identify your account and sync
  your progress across devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Usage Data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Learning progress</strong> — vocabulary words practiced, XP
  earned, streak data, and episode completion. Stored locally and synced to
  our backend so your progress persists.</li>
      <li><strong>Webtoon metadata</strong> — series and episode identifiers
  from comic.naver.com pages you visit while using the extension. Used to
  provide translations for the content you are reading.</li>
      <li><strong>Device timezone</strong> — your timezone (e.g.,
  "America/New_York") is sent with requests to correctly calculate daily
  practice streaks and day boundaries. This is not used for location
  tracking.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics events</strong> — we track your interactions with
  the extension to understand how features are used and to improve the
  learning experience. This includes: learning sessions started and completed,
   practice mode activity (starts, completions, and abandoned sessions),
  vocabulary answers (word, correctness, and response time), vocabulary
  lookups, onboarding steps, and chapter access. These events are tied to your
   account and stored on our backend.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Error Reports</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Crash and error data</strong> — we use Sentry to collect
  error reports including stack traces, browser version, and extension
  version. This helps us fix bugs. No personal content or browsing history is
  included in error reports.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide translations and vocabulary features on Naver Webtoon
  pages</li>
      <li>Save and sync your learning progress</li>
      <li>Process payments for premium features (via Stripe)</li>
      <li>Diagnose and fix technical issues</li>
      <li>Analyze feature usage to improve the learning experience</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the following third-party services to operate the extension:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Supabase</strong> — authentication and database hosting</li>
      <li><strong>Google Cloud Vision</strong> — optical character recognition
   (OCR) to extract text from webtoon images, processed on our backend</li>
      <li><strong>OpenAI</strong> — translation and language analysis,
  processed on our backend</li>
      <li><strong>Stripe</strong> — payment processing for premium
  subscriptions</li>
      <li><strong>Sentry</strong> — error monitoring and crash reporting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Webtoon image data sent for OCR and translation is processed in real
  time and not stored by these services beyond what is necessary to fulfill
  the request.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Locally</strong> — authentication tokens, preferences, and
  cached progress are stored in Chrome's local storage on your device.</li>
      <li><strong>Server-side</strong> — your account, learning progress, and
  vocabulary data are stored on our backend (api.mandubun.com) hosted
  securely.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties
  for marketing purposes. Data is only shared with the third-party services
  listed above as necessary to operate the extension.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete your account and all associated data by contacting us at
   <a href="mailto:support@mandubun.com">support@mandubun.com</a>. Upon
  account deletion, all server-side data will be removed. Local data can be
  cleared by uninstalling the extension.</p>

    <h2>7. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The extension requests the following browser permissions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>comic.naver.com</strong> — to inject the translation overlay
   on webtoon pages</li>
      <li><strong>image-comic.pstatic.net</strong> — to access webtoon panel
  images for OCR</li>
      <li><strong>api.mandubun.com</strong> — to communicate with our backend
  API</li>
      <li><strong>storage</strong> — to save your preferences and auth tokens
  locally</li>
      <li><strong>tabs</strong> — to open login and payment pages in new
  tabs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>This extension is not directed at children under 13. We do not
  knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on
  this page with an updated date.</p>
